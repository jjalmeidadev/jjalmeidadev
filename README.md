üéì I'm an 18 y/o brazilian who lives in S√£o Paulo, SP. I was blessed with opportunities to grow myself academically in, firstly, the **"Teddy Bear" and "Builders Educa√ß√£o Bil√≠ngue" schools**, where, together with my basic lessons, I was shown the perspective of english speaking and was able to initially grasp part of its possibilities, all in a very united environment. From there I moved to **"Dante Col√©gio Alighieri"**, the place I recently graduated in that, aside from building up on my previous knowledge with their **"Middle-High School" and electives programs**, taught me a lot about my position in society and set me to evolve as an active leader in dealing with its overwhelming issues. This path, now being nurtured by **INTELI as the college where I will develop myself as a Software Engineer**, leads me continuously closer to my dream of being part of the technological movement, having in mind that, since young, I've always been **fascinated by the progress it brought to our society, and really wanted to contribute with my own efforts for the general well-being and scientific advancement involved in it.** I'm known for being a very **approachable and friendly guy, always seeking for personal growth, intellectually and physically, hanging out with friends and having fun on a daily basis, so if you'd like to share any cool midia or work together in some project I can contribute to, please reach me out!** üí™

- üëæ As a very (doubtfully) cultured person since early on, I've grown fond of various entertainment contents such as **comics/manga, cinema and games**, being exposed to them for a long time and really appreciating how, simultaneously, **they are able to grant you wonderful experiences of excitement and teach you valuable lessons which you'll carry for the rest of your life**, often leaving you with the feeling of wanting more but inspiring you to cultivate good values. Current and interesting stuff I had contact with was the **"Assassins Creed RPG trilogy", the "Everything Everywhere All At Once" movie, "Black Mirror" series (which all devs should check out) and "One Piece and JJK" mangas (masterpieces in their own ways).**

- üéß I'm very eclectic musically, in the sense that I'll always enjoy actual quality songs, with the genres I mostly listen to being **pop, rock, jazz and electronics.**
  
- üèê In an ironic way, I really enjoy playing sports such as **volleyball and soccer at times**, even though I never practiced them seriously nor was engaged with actual games and teams themselves throughout competitions. By the way, my first curiosity would be that **I am a green, yellow and blue cord in Capoeira**, something that demonstrates my passion for physical activities.

- üìö Recently I also began admiring the construction of **philosophies and mythologies**, being topics I'd really like to learn more of.

- ‚úèÔ∏è I have as objectives for 2025 to resume my **drawing and guitar playing** activities.

- ‚ö° As a fun fact I have with me **a dedicated video of "Ronaldo Fen√¥meno"** that I really cherish.

- üìÑ My second and last curiosity would be about my experiences on **working on the ''We4N√≥s'' educational program as an english teacher and participating on ''Col√©gio Dante Alighieri's'' 2023 innovation symposium and 2024 UN debate event as participant and staff.**
